# Student Grade Calculator
This Python program allows you to input student names and their marks, then calculates the corresponding grade and provides a comment based on their performance. The results are stored in a list and displayed at the end.

# Features
Takes marks input and validates it (must be numeric and between 0-100).

Uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to assign grades and comments.

Stores student data (name, marks, grade, comment) in a list.

Allows multiple student entries until the user types "exit".

Displays all results after input completion.

Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs using try-except.

Utilizes loops (while and for) to control program flow and iterate over data.
